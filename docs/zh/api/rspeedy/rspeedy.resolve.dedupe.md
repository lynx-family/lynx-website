## Resolve.dedupe property

Force to resolve the specified packages from project root, which is useful for deduplicating packages and reducing the bundle size.

**Signature:**

```typescript
dedupe?: string[] | undefined;
```

## Remarks

[Resolve.dedupe](./rspeedy.resolve.dedupe.md) is implemented based on [Resolve.alias](./rspeedy.resolve.alias.md)<!-- -->, it will get the path of the specified package through `require.resolve` in the project root directory and set it to the alias.

The alias generated by [Resolve.dedupe](./rspeedy.resolve.dedupe.md) will be merged with the configured [Resolve.alias](./rspeedy.resolve.alias.md) in the project, and the [Resolve.alias](./rspeedy.resolve.alias.md) config will take precedence when the keys are the same.

## Example

Use `tslib` from the project root directory.

```js
import { defineConfig } from '@lynx-js/rspeedy'

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    dedupe: ['tslib'],
  },
})
```
