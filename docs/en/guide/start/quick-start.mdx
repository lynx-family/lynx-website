# Quick Start

Welcome to the Lynx documentation! We will create a Lynx project and start developing.

## System Requirements

- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en) or later.
  - Requires Node.js 18.19 when using TypeScript as configuration.

## Installation

### Create a new Lynx app

You can use the [`create-lynxjs-app`](https://github.com/lynx-community/cli) CLI tool to scaffold a new Lynx project with native projects already integrated. This approach is ideal when you want to build new app with Lynx from scratch.

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: 'npx create-lynxjs-app@latest',
    yarn: 'yarn create lynxjs-app',
    pnpm: 'pnpm create lynxjs-app@latest',
    bun: 'bunx create-lynxjs-app@latest',
  }}
/>

This will set up a project structure that includes native iOS and Android configurations alongside your Lynx code.

<Steps>

### Create a new Lynx project

We use Rspeedy (a Rspack-based Lynx build tool) to build Lynx projects.

It is recommended to start a new project using [`create-rspeedy`](https://npmjs.org/package/create-rspeedy),
which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rspeedy@latest" />

After completing the prompts, `create-rspeedy` will create a folder with your project name.

### Prepare Lynx Explorer

Lynx Explorer is a sandbox for trying out Lynx quickly.

<PlatformTabs queryKey="explorer-platform">

<PlatformTabs.Tab platform="ios-simulator">
We currently only provide pre-built binaries for the iOS simulator. If you need to run Lynx Explorer on a real iOS device, you'll need to build it from source. Please refer to the [Build Lynx Explorer for iOS](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx/tree/develop/explorer/darwin/ios) guide.

:::info
A version of Lynx Explorer is also available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lynx-go-dev-explorer/id6743227790), published by community contributors.
While this version is not reviewed and maintained by the Lynx team, we're thankful to the community for making it more convenient for developers to try out Lynx on iOS.

<PlatformTabs.Tab platform="harmony">
We currently only provide pre-built binaries for the harmony simulator. If you need to run Lynx Explorer on a real harmony device, you'll need to build it from source. Please refer to the [Build Lynx Explorer for Harmony](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx/tree/develop/explorer/harmony) guide.

1. **Install DevEco Studio**

Download the latest DevEco Studio from the [official website](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/deveco-studio/).

2. **<div id="download-lynx-explorer">Download Lynx Explorer</div>**

Download the pre-built app [`lynx_explorer-default-unsigned.hap`](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx/releases/latest/download/lynx_explorer-default-unsigned.hap).

Or, you may build from source by following the [Build Lynx Explorer for Harmony](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx/tree/develop/explorer/harmony) guide.

3. **Install Lynx Explorer on Simulator**

```bash
hdc install lynx_explorer-default-unsigned.hap
```

</PlatformTabs.Tab>

</PlatformTabs>

### Start developing

1. Navigate to the created project:

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

2. Install the NPM dependencies with package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install" />

3. To start the development server, run:

<PackageManagerTabs command="run dev" />

You will see a QR code showing up in the terminal, scan with your Lynx Explorer App or if you are using the simulator, just copy the bundle URL and paste it on the "Enter Card URL" input in the Lynx Explorer App and hit "Go".

4. Make your first change

Open the `src/App.tsx` file in your code editor and make a change.

You should see the UI on your Lynx Explorer being updated automatically.

<Go
  example="hello-world"
  defaultFile="src/App.tsx"
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/lynx-website/assets/doc/hello-world-showcase-ios.png"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/main.lynx.bundle"
/>
