### FAQ

##### After clicking `Load Trace` button shows: "Startup tracing is not enabled, cannot pull trace data"

- Make sure to set a valid trace duration (greater than 0) in Startup Trace Configuration, then restart the app and click `Load Trace` button again.
- Ensure a Lynx page is opened during or after the app startup process before clicking `Load Trace` button.

##### Clicking `Load Trace` button shows: "Startup tracing is in progress, please try again later"

- The app startup trace is still being recorded. Please wait for the process to finish and try clicking `Load Trace` button again later.
