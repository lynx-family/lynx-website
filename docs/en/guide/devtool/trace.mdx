# Trace

Trace is a performance analysis tool. With Trace, you can obtain a detailed rendering workflow of Lynx pages, making it easier to locate, analyze, and fix issues such as jank and long-running tasks.

## Core Capabilities of Trace

### 1. Visualizing the Rendering Pipeline

Trace provides a complete timeline view of the entire page process, detailing each stage: script execution, element construction, layout calculation, final rendering and others. With Trace, you can:

- Clearly see the time distribution for each key stage (such as layout and painting);
- Directly identify bottleneck nodes and performance issues;
- Detect redundant or repeated rendering tasks to optimize page performance.

This end-to-end visualization is especially valuable for page optimization and tuning complex page performance.

### 2. Tracing Engine Execution

Trace dives deep into the [Engine](/guide/spec.html#engine) and thoroughly records:

- The sequence of task scheduling and queue switching
- The full picture of event handling chains
- Precise timing and relationships for API calls

This information is useful for analyzing issues like asynchronous task congestion or event response delays.

### 3. Rich Performance Analysis Tools

Trace is a multidimensional performance analysis platform:

- **[Element](/guide/spec.html#element) Analysis**: Track changes in the Element tree structure, identify high-frequency or heavy node operations, and uncover performance risks in your page structure.

- **[NativeModules](/guide/spec.html#native-module) Call Analysis**: Monitor detailed NativeModules call processes, clearly display the timing and parameters of each NativeModule call, and pinpoint potential bottlenecks.

- **Smoothness Analysis**: Use flame charts of task durations to quickly locate the root causes of jank, helping you optimize animations and interactions.
