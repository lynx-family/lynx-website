# Trace

Trace is a performance analysis tool designed to help you identify and resolve performance issues in Lynx applications. With Trace, you can obtain a detailed rendering workflow of Lynx pages, making it easier to locate, analyze, and fix issues such as jank and long-running tasks.

## Core Capabilities of Trace

### 1. Visualizing the Rendering Pipeline

Trace provides a complete timeline view of the entire page process, from script execution and Element construction to layout calculation and final rendering. With Trace, you can:

- Clearly see the time distribution for each key stage (such as layout and painting);
- Directly identify bottleneck nodes and performance issues within the process;
- Detect redundant or repeated rendering tasks to optimize page structure.

This end-to-end visualization is especially valuable for page optimization and tuning complex page performance.

### 2. Tracing Framework Execution

Trace dives deep into the Lynx Engine and thoroughly records:

- The sequence of task scheduling and queue switching
- The full picture of event handling chains
- Precise timing and relationships for API calls

This information is invaluable for analyzing issues like asynchronous task congestion or event response delays.

### 3. Rich Performance Analysis Tools

Trace is more than just a "timeline"â€”it's a multidimensional performance analysis platform:

- **Element Analysis**: Track changes in the Element tree structure, identify high-frequency or high-cost node operations, and uncover performance risks in your page structure.

- **NativeModules Call Analysis**: Monitor detailed NativeModules call processes, clearly display the timing and parameters of each NativeModule call, and pinpoint potential bottlenecks.

- **Smoothness Analysis**: Use flame charts of task durations to quickly locate the root causes of jank, helping you optimize animations and interactions.
