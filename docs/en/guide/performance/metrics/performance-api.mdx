# Performance API

Similar to [Web Standards](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance), Lynx provides the Performance API for obtaining performance-related information in the current page.

Developers can use the Performance interface to retrieve various runtime performance data.

The following core concepts need to be understood when using the Performance API:

- **Entry Object**  
  [`lynx.performance`](/api/lynx-api/lynx/lynx-performance) is the entry object of the performance monitoring system, used to create performance observers.

- **Performance Observer**  
  The [`PerformanceObserver`](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-observer) interface monitors various types of performance events.

- **Performance Events**  
  Represented by [`PerformanceEntry`](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry), containing basic information: event `name` and `entryType`.
  All performance events (e.g., application initialization duration, page loading time) inherit from the `PerformanceEntry` interface and extend additional properties.
