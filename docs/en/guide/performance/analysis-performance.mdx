# Performance Analysis

This section guides you through performance analysis methodologies, from diagnosing rendering latency and instrumenting business logic to optimizing page fluency and memory usage, enabling comprehensive smoothness and stability improvements.

## Rendering Latency Analysis

### Record Trace data

Use [Devtool](/guide/devtool/trace/record-trace) to record Trace data. The Trace is presented on a [timeline](/guide/performance/analysis-performance/trace-track), capturing the full Lynx rendering pipeline, which lays the foundation for subsequent analysis.

### Analyze rendering latency

On the [Rendering-time analysis](/guide/performance/analysis-performance/analysis-render-process) page, combine Trace data to review first-frame rendering and page update flows, pinpoint time-consuming stages and performance bottlenecks along the rendering path. The [NativeModule invocation](/guide/performance/analysis-performance/analysis-native-module) page explains the complete execution flow of NativeModule calls to help you analyze them efficiently.

### Add custom instrumentation

Trace allows developers to add [custom Trace instrumentation](/guide/performance/analysis-performance/trace-api). Insert Trace events into key business flows, component lifecycles, and asynchronous tasks to visualize them on the Trace UI timeline, enabling precise tracking and localization of potential bottlenecks.

## Memory Analysis

The [Memory analysis](/guide/performance/analysis-performance/analysis-memory) page describes how to use Trace and IDE tools to analyze memory peaks, growth trends, and abnormal leaks, helping developers discover and fix memory issues early to improve application stability.

## Fluency

The [Fluency analysis](/guide/performance/analysis-performance/analysis-fluency) page explains how to analyze dropped frames and jank, enabling developers to quickly locate and optimize page interaction performance.
