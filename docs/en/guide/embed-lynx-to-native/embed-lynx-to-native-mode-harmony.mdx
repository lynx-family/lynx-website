### Getting Size Constraints in `onMeasureSize`

The ArkUI framework passes node information and size ranges to custom components through [onMeasureSize](<https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/harmonyos-references/ts-custom-component-layout#onmeasuresize10)>) when determining component dimensions.

At this stage, the size constraints given to LynxView by the outer view can be obtained. Lynx will complete the layout of all nodes within the system's `onMeasureSize` function and calculate the size of LynxView
