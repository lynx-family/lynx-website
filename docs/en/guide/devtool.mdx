## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

**Question**: Why can't Lynx DevTool desktop application recognize my debugging device?

**Answer**: Make sure you have connected your development device (e.g., your MacBook) and the device running the Lynx application (e.g., your phone) using a data cable.

For iOS devices, ensure that you have installed Xcode and iOS SDK with matching versions on your development device.

For Android devices, in addition to ensuring a data cable connection, you also need to enable Developer Mode and USB debugging on your Android device:

1. Enable Developer Mode on your Android device - specific steps may vary between devices, please refer to the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
2. Enable "USB Debugging" in the developer options
3. When the device is connected to your computer, an authorization prompt will appear, click "Allow"

You can try launching Xcode or Android Studio to compile and run an application to verify that you can connect to the device properly.
