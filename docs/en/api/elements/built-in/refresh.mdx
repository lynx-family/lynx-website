# `<refresh>`

`<refresh>` element provides a pull-to-refresh gesture that reveals a customizable header view while new data is being fetched.

It fires the `refresh` event when the user pulls down past a configurable threshold, allowing you to trigger asynchronous updates and automatically hide the header once the operation completes.

## Usage

- `<refresh>` only supports vertical pull-to-refresh gestures.
- It accepts up to two direct children: `<refresh-header>` and `<view>` has vertically scrollable inside.

### Pull to refresh

Define the refresh effect through `<refresh-header>`, and set `enable-refresh` to true for `<refresh>`.

1. Pull to refresh: Drag down or call `autoStartRefresh` to lock the `<refresh-header>` at the top and fire the `startrefresh` event.

2. Finish loading: Call `finishRefresh` to animate the `<refresh-header>` out of view.
