# MouseEvent

Represents a mouse event, inherited from [`Event`](./event), which is a type of event that describes the user's interaction with the mouse. For example, mouse click.

## Instance property

### button

```ts
button: number;
```

When a mouse event is triggered, if any mouse button is pressed or released, a integer value representing this mouse button will be returned.

| Value | Description            |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | primary mouse button   |
| 2     | secondary mouse button |
| 3     | middle mouse button    |

### buttons

```ts
buttons: number;
```

When a mouse event is triggered, if any buttons are pressed, a integer value representing multiple buttons which user is pressing will be returned. Each button occupies one bit field.

| Bit | Description            |
| --- | ---------------------- |
| 0   | primary mouse button   |
| 1   | secondary mouse button |
| 2   | middle mouse button    |

### x

```ts
x: number;
```

Represents the horizontal axis position of the mouse pointer in the `UI` coordinate system that contains the mouse pointer and is closest to the user.

### y

```ts
y: number;
```

Represents the vertical axis position of the mouse pointer in the `UI` coordinate system that contains the mouse pointer and is closest to the user.

### pageX

```ts
pageX: number;
```

Indicates the horizontal axis position of the mouse pointer in the current `LynxView` coordinate system.

### pageY

```ts
pageY: number;
```

Represents the vertical axis position of the mouse pointer in the current `LynxView` coordinate system.

### clientX

```ts
clientX: number;
```

Indicates the horizontal axis position of the mouse pointer in the current window coordinate system.

### clientY

```ts
clientY: number;
```

Indicates the vertical axis position of the mouse pointer in the current window coordinate system.

## Type of MouseEvent

### mousedown

Indicates a mouse button is pressed (primary or secondary). [`target`](./event#target) is the `UI` closest to the user that contains the mouse pointer.

### mousemove

Indicates that the mouse moves after `mousedown`. [`target`](./event#target) is always the same as [`target`](./event#target) of `mousedown`.

### mouseup

Indicates that the mouse button is released, [`target`](./event#target) is the same as `mousedown`'s [`target`](./event#target).

### mouseenter

Indicates that the mouse moves into the activation area of [`target`](./event#target) for the first time. [`target`](./event#target) is the `UI` that contains the mouse pointer and is closest to the user.

Note: the `mouseenter` event does not bubble, and it can't be captured by using `capture-` API.

### mouseover

Indicates that the mouse is moving inside [`target`](./event#target) after `mouseenter`. [`target`](./event#target) is the `UI` that contains the mouse pointer and is closest to the user.

### mouseleave

Indicates that the mouse moves out of the activation area of [`target`](./event#target) for the first time. [`target`](./event#target) is the same as previous `mouseenter`.

Note: the `mouseleave` event does not bubble, and it can't be captured by using `capture-` API.
