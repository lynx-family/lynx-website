## Examples

This example shows how to generate and obtain `AndroidHostPlatformTiming`.

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="performance-api"
  defaultFile="src/HostPlatformTiming/index.tsx"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/HostPlatformTiming.lynx.bundle"
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/plugin/static/exmaple-host-platform-timing.png"
  entry="src/HostPlatformTiming"
/>

## Instance Properties

### hostPlatformType

```tsx
hostPlatformType: string;
```

A string describing the Host Platform type, with default value: `Android`.

### measureStart

```tsx
measureStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the first execution of [LynxView](/guide/spec.html#lynxview)'s [onMeasure](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#onMeasure(int,%20int)>) starts in a Lynx Pipeline. This timestamp is a Unix timestamp represented as a floating-point number (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### measureEnd

```tsx
measureEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the last execution of [LynxView](/guide/spec.html#lynxview)'s [`onMeasure`](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#onMeasure(int,%20int)>) ends in a Lynx Pipeline. This timestamp is a Unix timestamp represented as a floating-point number (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### layoutStart

```tsx
layoutStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the first execution of [LynxView](/guide/spec.html#lynxview)'s [`onLayout`](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#onLayout(boolean,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)>) starts in a Lynx Pipeline. This timestamp is a Unix timestamp represented as a floating-point number (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### layoutEnd

```tsx
layoutEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the last execution of [LynxView](/guide/spec.html#lynxview)'s [`onLayout`](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#onLayout(boolean,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)>) ends in a Lynx Pipeline. This timestamp is a Unix timestamp represented as a floating-point number (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### drawStart

```tsx
drawStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the execution of [LynxView](/guide/spec.html#lynxview)'s [`dispatchDraw`](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#dispatchDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)>) starts in a Lynx Pipeline. This timestamp is a Unix timestamp represented as a floating-point number (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### drawEnd

```tsx
drawEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the execution of [LynxView](/guide/spec.html#lynxview)'s [`dispatchDraw`](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#dispatchDraw(android.graphics.Canvas)>) ends in a Lynx Pipeline. This timestamp is a Unix timestamp represented as a floating-point number (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.
