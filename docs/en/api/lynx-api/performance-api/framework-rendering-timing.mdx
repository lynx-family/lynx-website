# FrameworkRenderingTiming

This interface describes the performance data of key stages in [framework rendering](/guide/spec#framework-rendering).

In the [First-screen Rendering](/guide/spec#first-screen-rendering-or-fsr) and [Re-rendering](/guide/spec#re-rendering), the framework is responsible for a series of critical tasks. The diagram below illustrates the significant steps of framework rendering in the entire FSR and Re-rendering processes:

- **The yellow sections represent the key phases of framework rendering**.
- The green sections represent the key phases of [Engine Rendering (Pixel Pipeline)](/guide/spec#pixel-pipeline), with details available at [PipelineEntry](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/pipeline-entry).
- The purple sections represent the key phases of [Lynx Engine](/guide/spec#engine), with details available at [LoadBundleEntry](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry/load-bundle-entry).

## Instance Properties

### dsl

```tsx
dsl: string;
```

A string describing the DSL type, with a default value of `reactlynx`.

### stage

```tsx
stage: string;
```

A string describing the type of framework data update process, with possible values `hydrate` and `update`. `hydrate` refers to the process of calibrating and updating [main thread](/guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread) data using [background thread](/guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread) data, while `update` refers to updates triggered in `useEffect`. For more information, see [ReactLynx Lifecycle](/react/lifecycle).

### diffVdomStart

```tsx
diffVdomStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts VDom Diff on the [background thread](/guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### diffVdomEnd

```tsx
diffVdomEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends VDom Diff on the [background thread](/guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### packChangesStart

```tsx
packChangesStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts serializing change information on the [background thread](/guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### packChangesEnd

```tsx
packChangesEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends serializing change information on the [background thread](/guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### parseChangesStart

```tsx
parseChangesStart: number;
```

### parseChangesEnd

```tsx
parseChangesEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends deserializing change information on the [main thread](/guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### patchChangesStart

```tsx
patchChangesStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts applying change information on the [main thread](/guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### patchChangesEnd

```tsx
patchChangesEnd: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework ends applying change information on the [main thread](/guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread). This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds), accurate to three decimal places. For example: 1739594612307.429.

### hydrateParseSnapshotStart

```tsx
hydrateParseSnapshotStart: number;
```

The timestamp when the framework starts deserializing [main thread](/guide/spec.html#main-thread-or-lynx-main-thread) information on the [background thread](/guide/spec.html#background-thread-aka-off-main-thread).
