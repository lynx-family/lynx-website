# LazyBundleEntry

Through [lazy loading components](/react/code-splitting.html#lazy-loading-components), developers can render on demand, thereby improving user experience. `LazyBundleEntry` is used to record the performance data of lazy loading components and inherits from [`PerformanceEntry`](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry).

## Example

This example demonstrates how to obtain a `LazyBundleEntry`.

import { Go } from '@lynx';

<Go
  example="performance-api"
  defaultFile="src/lazy-bundle-entry/index.tsx"
  defaultEntryFile="dist/lazy-bundle-entry.lynx.bundle"
  img="https://lf-lynx.tiktok-cdns.com/obj/lynx-artifacts-oss-sg/plugin/static/exmaple-lazy-bundle-entry.png"
  entry="src/lazy-bundle-entry"
  highlight="{17-22,31-33}"
/>

## Instance properties

### [entryType](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#entryType)

```ts
entryType: string;
```

The type of the performance event; the value for all instances of this class is fixed as `resource`.

### [name](/api/lynx-api/performance-api/performance-entry#name)

```ts
name: string;
```

The name of the performance event; the value for all instances of this class is fixed as `lazyBundle`.

### componentUrl

```tsx
componentUrl: string;
```

The URL string used to load the lazy loading component.

### size

```tsx
size: number;
```

The resource size of the lazy loading component, in bytes.

### mode

```tsx
mode: string;
```

The mode for loading the lazy loading component, with values: `preload` or `normal`.

### sync

```tsx
sync: boolean;
```

Whether the lazy loading component is rendered synchronously.

### loadSuccess

```tsx
loadSuccess: boolean;
```

Whether the lazy loading component was loaded successfully.

### requireStart

```tsx
requireStart: number;
```

The start timestamp for downloading the lazy loading component.This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds).

### requireEnd

```tsx
requireEnd: number;
```

The end timestamp for downloading the lazy loading component.This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds).

### decodeStart

```tsx
decodeStart: number;
```

The start timestamp for decoding the lazy loading component.This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds).

### decodeEnd

```tsx
decodeEnd: number;
```

The end timestamp for decoding the lazy loading component.This timestamp is a floating-point Unix timestamp (in milliseconds).
