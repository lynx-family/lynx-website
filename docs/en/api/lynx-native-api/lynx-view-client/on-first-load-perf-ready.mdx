# onFirstLoadPerfReady

Performance data statistics callback after the first load is completed.

## Syntax

### Android

```java
public void onFirstLoadPerfReady(LynxPerfMetric metric);
```

:::note

- The timing of the callback is not fixed due to differences in rendering threads, and should not be used as a starting point for any business side. The callback is in the main thread.
