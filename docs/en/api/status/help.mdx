This guide explains how to use the Lynx API Status Dashboard to explore API compatibility across different platforms.

## Overview

The API Status Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all 1,092+ Lynx APIs and their support status across multiple platforms including Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, Web, and Clay (cross-platform desktop).

## Platform Selector

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find the **Platform Selector** which allows you to switch between different platforms to view their specific API coverage.

### Native Platforms

- **Android** - Mobile Android platform
- **iOS** - Apple iOS platform
- **Harmony** - HarmonyOS platform
- **Web** - Web Lynx implementation

Each platform button shows its name, icon, and current API coverage percentage.

### Clay Platforms

Click the **Clay** toggle button to reveal additional Clay platform options:

Clay platforms include:

- **Clay (Android)** - Clay running on Android
- **Clay (iOS)** - Clay running on iOS
- **Clay (macOS)** - Clay running on macOS
- **Clay (Windows)** - Clay running on Windows

## Search and Filters

### Search Box

Use the search box to quickly find specific APIs by name or description. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial text.

**Examples:**

- Search `image` to find all image-related APIs
- Search `scroll` to find scrolling functionality
- Search `animation` to find animation APIs

### Category Filter

The first dropdown allows you to filter APIs by category:

- **All** - Show all categories
- **ELEMENT** - Element-related APIs
- **CSS** - CSS property support
- **API** - JavaScript API methods

### State Filter

The second dropdown filters APIs by their support status on the selected platform:

- **All** - Show all APIs
- **Supported** - Only show supported APIs
- **Unsupported** - Only show unsupported APIs

---

## API List

The API list displays all matching APIs in a two-column grid layout.

### Reading API Items

Each API item shows:

- **Category badge** (e.g., `ELEMENT`, `CSS`, `API`)
- **API name** (e.g., `commonality`, `image.loop-count`)
- **Color coding**:
  - 🟢 **Green background** - API is supported on the selected platform
  - 🔴 **Red background** - API is not supported on the selected platform

### Show All Results

By default, only the first 100 results are shown for performance. Click **"Show All"** to display all matching results.

---

## API Detail Drawer

Click on any API item to open the detailed compatibility drawer:

### Compatibility Table

The drawer shows a compatibility table with:

- **Rows** - Each sub-API or property
- **Columns** - All platforms (Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, macOS, Windows, Web)

### Understanding the Icons

| Icon           | Meaning                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ✓ with version | Supported since that version |
| ✗ No           | Not supported                |
| ?              | Support status unknown       |

### View Source

Click the **"View source"** link to see the raw compatibility data in the GitHub repository.

---

## Coverage Card

The **Coverage Card** (left bottom) shows detailed statistics for the selected platform:

### Stats Display

- **Percentage** - Overall API coverage (e.g., 85%)
- **Fraction** - Exact count (e.g., 924 / 1,092)
- **Progress bar** - Visual representation with platform-specific color

---

## Category Table

The **Coverage** section provides a breakdown by API category.

### Reading the Table

| Column   | Description                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Category | API category name (e.g., Elements, CSS) |
| Coverage | Percentage and count of supported APIs  |
| Missing  | Number of unsupported APIs (if any)     |

### Highlight Modes

Use the toggle buttons to switch highlight modes:

- **Highlight Good** (Green mode) - Emphasizes high coverage categories

  - Darker green = Higher coverage (95%+)
  - Lighter green = Lower coverage
  - Gray = Below 50%

- **Highlight Gap** (Red mode) - Emphasizes low coverage categories
  - Darker red = Lower coverage (below 50%)
  - Lighter red = Moderate gaps
  - Gray = Above 95%

### Expanding Categories

Click on any category row to expand it and see the individual APIs within that category.

---

## Trend Chart

The **Trend** section (right bottom) shows the historical API coverage trend:

- **X-axis** - Lynx versions
- **Y-axis** - API coverage percentage
- **Line** - Coverage progression over time

This helps you understand how API support has improved across versions.

---

## Recently Added APIs

At the very bottom, the **Recently Added** section lists APIs that were recently added to Lynx, grouped by version.

### Version Groups

Each version group shows:

- **Version number** (e.g., v3.5)
- **API count** for the selected platform
- **List of APIs** added in that version

This is useful for tracking new features in each Lynx release.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start with platform selection** - Choose your target platform first to see relevant coverage data.

2. **Use search for specific APIs** - If you know the API name, search is faster than scrolling.

3. **Check the drawer for details** - The compatibility table shows version-specific information.

4. **Monitor trends** - Use the trend chart to understand coverage improvements over time.

5. **Toggle Clay for desktop** - Enable Clay platforms if you're building cross-platform desktop apps.
