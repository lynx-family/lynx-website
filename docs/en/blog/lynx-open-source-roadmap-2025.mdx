# Lynx Roadmap 2025

<BlogAvatar list={['liushouqun']} />

[Two weeks ago](blog/lynx-unlock-native-for-more), we launched Lynx as an open-source project and have since gathered valuable insights and feedback from the community. Thank you for engaging with Lynx, even as we take our first steps as a new member of the open-source cross-platform ecosystem. Today, I'm pleased to share the 2025 roadmap of Lynx.

Our core principles in developing the Lynx technology family and building the Lynx tech ecosystem are:

- **Fast and stable releases**: Ensuring rapid version updates while maintaining a stable API with minimal breaking changes.
- **Versatile cross-platform**: Empowering developers with efficient, high-performance solutions across major platforms.
- **Strong community support**: Engaging with developers through [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/lynx-family), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mXk7jqdDXk), StackOverflow, etc.

## Release Schedule

We believe that consistent version releases are crucial for a developer framework to ensure features and refinements reach users effectively. In 2025, we plan to publish 5 stable releases.

| **Stable Release Version** | 3.2     | 3.3     | 3.4     | 3.5     | 3.6     |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Planned Release Date**   | 2025/04 | 2025/06 | 2025/08 | 2025/10 | 2025/12 |

## Documentation

High-quality documentation and examples are essential for a great developer experience. Our team is committed to publishing and maintaining accurate, up-to-date documentation on our website (https://lynxjs.org).
Additionally, the website's repository is open-sourced (https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-website) and will be maintained transparently. We highly welcome any feedback or contributions to our documentation.

## Multiple Platforms

We are providing a cross-platform framework for building apps across a wide range of platforms. This includes mobile platforms like Android, iOS, and the Web, all of which we have already open-sourced. Additionally, Lynx supports desktop environments such as Windows and macOS, as well as emerging platforms like OpenHarmony. With coverage across those major platforms, we have a clear plan to continue open-sourcing our framework this year.

- Support for Android, iOS, and the Web are already open sourced. We will continue enhancing cross-platform consistency and performance on these platforms to provide developers with better solutions for building mobile applications.
- OpenHarmony: We plan to open source Lynx OpenHarmony support on version 3.4.
- macOS and Windows: We also plan to release Lynx macOS and Windows support to open source on version 3.5.

## More Capabilities & UI Elements

We have received multiple requests for additional APIs and components, as well as feedback on integrating Lynx into various products. To empower developers in building fully fledged applications with Lynx, in addition to the already open-sourced core engine and front-end stack, we plan to open-source more peripherals this year, including:

- Additional UI elements and components, such as input, view pagers, swiper, and SVG support.
- Support for [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) and advanced animations, such as [Lottie](https://airbnb.io/lottie/), along with our open-source implementations.
- App-level capabilities, including native navigation and APIs for features like notifications, location, and more.

## Tooling

We also received a lot of feedback about the toolchain's compatibility on Windows and Linux platforms. Moving forward, we'll ensure toolchain support across major development platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux.

For developer tools, we will continue improving the capability and stability of DevTools. Later this year, we plan to introduce performance profilers to help developers diagnose and resolve possible performance issues.

## Community

As a family of technologies designed to empower developers, we believe a strong community ecosystem is essential to its success. That's why we have open-sourced our technologies, and will continue building and enhancing the community.

- To advance our vision of democratizing cross-platform technologies, we aim to collaborate with the community to further enhance the [Element PAPI](https://lynxjs.org/guide/spec.html#element-papi), making it more framework-agnostic and better suited to support more frameworks on Lynx engine.
- We are dedicated to actively discussing, responding to, and addressing developers' feedback across all major community platforms, including Discord, GitHub, and StackOverflow.

After open-sourcing Lynx, our team has been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the community. We've received a wealth of feedback on improving the framework, which has greatly motivated each of us. In the future, we look forward to collaborating with the community and continuously releasing updates to support developers.
