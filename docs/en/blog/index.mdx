Lynx 3.5 is now officially released! Following our stable bi-monthly release cadence, Lynx 3.5 brings several key improvements. This release adds experimental support for React Compiler, enhances main thread scripts with `stopPropagation` for better event bubbling control, enables immediate interactivity after first-frame rendering, and improves cross-thread communication. We've also expanded HarmonyOS platform support and introduced new features like the `pointer-events` CSS property.
